# HTTP denial-of-potatoes

Collection of scripts attempting *trivial* [denial-of-service attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) against HTTP clients.

This is not going to work against `curl`, `wget` or any other serious client. But they will help if you're writing your own HTTP client and want to check it for susceptibility to basic DoS attacks.  

## Usage

Run the script, then connect to localhost:8080 using the HTTP client you want to test.

Contributions of these scripts are welcome!

- [ ] Slow header transfer (tests timeouts)
- [ ] Slow body transfer (tests timeouts)
- [ ] The above combined with redirects (vulns: [1](https://github.com/algesten/ureq/pull/313), [2](https://github.com/sbstp/attohttpc/issues/85), ...)
- [ ] 

...and anything else that you've seen cause issues in HTTP clients. Combing through security advisories for curl, etc is probably a good strategy for discovering failure modes.
